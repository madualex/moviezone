This is a React app that FETCHES MOVIES through API. It was the start of my journey in learning to build real life functional application. API is a great deal, I am happy to have started with this project.
While this project is not my original work, I am proud to say that I watched, coded and studied every single line of the project (and I still do).
The next series of commits that will follow are modifications that I will be making to the projects to make them close to being mine.
